Unix not UNIX - it doesn't stand for anything. It's an operating system, especially popular on servers and web servers.

MacOS is based on Unix. We can use Unix commands in MacOS. First one in 1969. It branched out into many versions.

The reason has lasted so long is that it is robust. HP, Solaris, and other big companies use custom versions of it.

When we use Unix we use Shell - takes in commands and then executes them. We use GUIs (Graphic User Interface). We use the command line for speed. 

Unix has a similar structure to  windows in that it branches down like an upside down tree. The home directory is root which is represented by a “/“. 

There are different applications (Terminal, etc) and different shells (which are built-in). The basic commands will be the same throughout the different platforms but the basic commands are usable in all of them.

The home directory is marked by “~” - this is not root. This helps deal with different users on the same system.

Best practice is to not put spaces in filenames.

Useful commands: 
	pwd				print working directory e.g. /Users/martabeveridge
	ls				list files in directory
	ls -a	list 			files with hidden files
	ls -l	long 			form of file, includes ownership, size, modified date, etc
	ls -t				sorts by mod date
	ls -alt				does all of the above
	Ctrl-L				clears screen
	mkdir				create directory
	mv				can be used to rename or move
	cp				copy file
	rm				remove files
	rmdir				delete directory (only when it's empty)
	rm -rf				delete directory and all files in it - be careful when using! - when you delete 						something in unix it's gone
	atom . 				open every file in the directory in atom
	history				shows list of all commands typed
	history | grep "touch"		looks for commands with touch in the name, use [] to search for characters

Functions are reusable and allow you to break the code into smaller parts which are easier to maintain and debug. In Ruby they start with def and end with end.

Functions can't begin with a number, they must begin with a lowercase letter and have no special characters. Variables declared in functions can't be used outside of the function but functions can use variables declared outside the function.

Parameters is what the function takes def greet(person), and argument is what you give it when you call it p greet("Marta").

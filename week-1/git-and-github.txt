Version control is useful to work in groups. Imagine trying to write an essay between 20 people via email. Dropbox has versions but no merging, google docs has merging but bad version control. Enter Git. Git is a method of versioning files. It can be used individually or in groups. 

GitHub is the social version of Git. It serves for people to put up their open source projects. 

Why is Git good? Because you can work offline and put it online later. 

Git mantra:
	make changes
	add changes
	commit

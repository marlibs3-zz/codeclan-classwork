Ruby is one the newest programming languages.

In Ruby everything is an object. Even something passed in quotes will be able to have things asked of it such as "Marta".class or 2.class.

You can pass "string" + "string" and it'll make "string string". A variable is a bucket in which you can store things, for example if you are playing basketball you would want a variable to store the score.

camelCase means a way of formatting where you start with lower case and put an upper case for each new word. ruby-doc.org is the website where all the ruby documentation is. Ruby knows not to mash things together like it'll give you an error if you want to add a string and an integer.

An object HAS stuff and DOES stuff. String has a length, string can be uppercased.

To enter a ruby developing environment in a Terminal you type irb, to exit you type exit. When you have more than one method after a variable it'll execute them in order.

== checking equality

we can only == things that are the same type so you might need to convert things. 

In atom you need cmd + / to input a comment. It'll know what format of comment you need depending on the file extension.

Ruby goes through cases in order so if you have a score = 10. case = 10 puts well done, case = 8..10 puts pretty good - it'll detect the first case so this would account for decimals.

Instead of if or case you can use guard which is a more simplified and readable way of doing a basic if statement such as:
result = "fail"

# if score >= 6
#   result = "pass"
# end

result = "pass" if score >= 6

puts result

&& both conditions need to be true
|| one or other condition is true

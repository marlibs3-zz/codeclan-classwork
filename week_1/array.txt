Arrays are 0 indexed, this means an array behaves like this:
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  0  1  2  3  4

Think of it as distance from the first item. In a lot of languages you have to tell the array what size it will be beforehand. In Ruby we don't need to do that - dynamic size array. Ruby is quite a flexible language. Referring to -1 brings the last element in the array.

fruits.push('pear')
p fruits
fruits.pop()
p fruits

push puts something at the end, pop takes away from the end. pop(2) takes away the last two.

# BRACKETS CHEAT SHEET

# SQUARE BRACKETS = create Arrays and access an element of an Array using its index
my_array = ["a","b","c"] #creates an Array with 3 items
p my_array[2] #returns third the item in the Array my_array, which is "c"

# ROUND BRACKETS = inside it, you're passing an arguments into a function
p my_array.push("d") # pass the argument "d" into function push() or the object my_array,  which adds "d" to the end of the array

# CURLY BRACKETS = creating Hashes
hash = {"a"=>"aaa", "b"=>"bbb"} # create a Hash
